		<h1> The Road Not Taken </h1>
		<h3> By <i> Robert Frost </i> </h3>

		<i> 
			Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
			And sorry I could not travel both <br>
			And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
			And looked down one as far as I could <br>
			To where it bent in the undergrowth;
		</i>
		</p>
		<p>
		<i>
			Then took the other, as just as fair, <br>
			And having perhaps the better claim <br>
			Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
			Though as for that the passing there <br>
			Had worn them really about the same,
		</i>
		</p>
		<p>
		<i>
			And both that morning equally lay <br>
			In leaves no step had trodden black. <br>
			Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>
			Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>
			I doubted if I should ever come back.
		</i>
		</p>
		<p>
		<i>
			I shall be telling this with a sight <br>
			Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
			Two roads diverged in a wood, and I&mdash; <br>
     		I took the one less traveled by, <br>
			And that has made all the difference.
